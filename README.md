## Introduction
This is the project to create my personal website (portfolio, blog, and project showcase). The tech stack for this big project will be included below.

## portfolio (hungry5656.github.io)
This is what I used as an introduction to myself (like a resume) without private personal information.

I will create this web page using the following tech stack
- next.js
- react.js
- node.js
- javascript
- css
- html
- bootstrap

## blog
For this sub webpage, I an using [chirpy jekyll theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) to save the time developing the blog system. For this blog site, I will include mainly my thoughts about different tech and share some experience in both technology and non-tech(recipe, sports, music, etc.). Even after I already used template to create the blog site, I still need to utilize some of the tech skill to allow it fits my main website(hungry5656.github.io) correctly. Here are the skills required for this part:
- Writing skill (Most important one!!!)
- scss (to add extra class attributes)
- markdown
- CI/CD deployment

## project showcase
The first two parts are all gonna be deployed on Github pages, which means both of them are statically generated website(generated during the build and deployment process in CI/CD). This may not be supported by my project showcase since it needs to support different types of projects. Also, the demo interaction with user requires the RESTful APIs to the backend, it has to have a server side to process the request and return the results. For this reason. I will use the instance from Oracle Cloud for Always free account. Here is the projected skills required for this section.

- frontend (React.js)

- Intermediate level - (nginx)

- flask (micro framework)
- python (used in flask)
- - call subprocess (which calls my cpp project)
